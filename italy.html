    <p> We went to Italy for our friends' wedding on the island of Sardinia one month after our own wedding in 2014. The ceremony was traditionally Catholic and the reception took place at a little hall near the church. </p>

      From Sardinia, we flew directly to Rome where we had delicious pasta and tiramisu. We explored the city on foot and saw the Spanish steps, the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and St. Peter's Basilica. We went to an American bar at night to have Fireball
      shots with our friends.

    <p>After a drunken night, we took a bus from Rome to Naples and then onto Positano in the Amalfi Coast. The views were stunning. During the day, we hiked the Path of the Gods. The beaches were too rocky to enjoy. Every night, we were picked up by the
      restaurant and taken to cliff-side dining. The sangria was always fresh and very cheap. Positano was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. </p>
